# S03: P4 Runs Before P3

## Purpose

Verify that P3 and P4 are independent after P2 while remaining aware of current
sibling information when it exists.

## Initial state

- P1 and P2 current records exist.
- The user has selected an active method.
- No P3 or P4 record exists for that method.

## User action

The user launches P4 in preliminary scope before running P3.

## Expected behavior

- The manifest records that no P3 sibling basis was available.
- Analyst, theorist, and lead execute in that fixed order.
- P4 publishes a cumulative evidence record bound to the exact method identity.
- Absence of P3 is reported as missing sibling information, not as proof that the
  method lacks theoretical support.

The user then launches P3.

- P3 receives the current P4 evidence index, empirical synthesis, and implementation record as its structured sibling basis.
- The theorist uses relevant empirical information without treating it as proof.
- P3 publishes one current theory record and records the exact P4 basis considered.

## Prohibited behavior

- P4 does not automatically launch P3.
- P3 does not rewrite the P4 record.
- Neither phase substitutes its evidence type for the other.
