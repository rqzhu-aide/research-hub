# Executable phase contracts

## Sources

The prose files under `../phases/` define scientific meaning. The five files
under `phases/` are the reviewable executable contracts for P1 through P5.
`phases.json` is the generated complete registry.

An implementation does not parse Markdown at runtime. It loads the selected JSON
contract, validates it against `../schemas/phase-contract.schema.json`, and
requires the command and run manifest to freeze the same contract version and digest.

Rebuild the aggregate with:

## User-choice materialization

A command selects one `mode_id` and supplies one `choice_values` object keyed by
the exact choice IDs declared for that mode. Each choice declares a `value_kind`.
The harness requires every mode-required choice, permits only its declared
optional choices, and validates every value before preparation. The manifest
copies this map exactly. It does not reinterpret a generic scope or method field.

## Run materialization

The selected phase and mode resolve to one exact ordered stage plan. The run
manifest freezes for every role step:

- `stage_id` and `execution_group_id`;
- serial or parallel execution;
- role and versioned profile;
- exact `input_ids` and `output_ids`;
- one unique `role_write_root`.

Each contract-selected manifest input carries the corresponding
`contract_binding_id`, and each expected output carries its
`contract_output_id`. `schema_application` states whether the declared schema
validates one object or every item in a collection.

Shared `reads` apply to every role in a stage. If `role_reads` is present, it
replaces shared reads and declares one exact set for every stage role. A role may
read only declared formal inputs, immutable contexts prepared by the harness, or
outputs fixed by an earlier stage.

`prepared_contexts` describes an immutable input constructed during preparation
from declared formal inputs and user choices. Its source identities, mode scope,
content requirements, and digest are frozen before role work begins.

## Publication materialization

`publication_bindings` is the only executable source of formal publication
targets. Each mode-scoped binding names contract output IDs, an `append`,
`upsert_each`, `replace`, or `bundle` operation, its cumulative collection or
current slot, prior-target policy, and any named bundle components. A declared
publisher transform may build an index or package deterministically, but
`may_create_scientific_content` is always `false`.

The run manifest materializes these bindings as an exact `publication_plan`
with run-local output IDs, exact target IDs or keyed-slot templates, expected
prior generations, and explicit prior input mappings for deterministic reducers.
An optional prior input is recorded as a frozen input or an explicit absence.
An unbound, multiply bound, mode-inapplicable, or stale
formal operation blocks publication. The publisher never infers a target from a
filename, output kind, or prose label.

`canonical_record_types` identifies current record types. Separate
`cumulative_object_types` identifies immutable objects that append without
occupying a current slot. These include literature sources, evidence items,
stable attention-item versions, and Phase 5 review-issue versions where the
phase declares them.

## Phase 5 review boundary

Phase 5 assembly requires the current method, theory, and empirical records to
match the exact selected method identity.

Review-revision may freeze an older manuscript only when it belongs to the same
stable method lineage. It never accepts a manuscript from another method. The
harness constructs `p5.review_packet` from the selected manuscript, reviewer-
visible supporting material, and reviewer-facing instructions.

The parallel review stage uses distinct frozen reads:

- the theorist receives the review packet, current manuscript, exact method,
  current theory, and literature synthesis;
- the data analyst receives the review packet, current manuscript, exact method,
  current empirical index, synthesis, implementation record, and literature synthesis;
- the outside reviewer receives only `p5.review_packet`.

The research lead receives all three fixed reports only in the later revision
stage.

## Downstream effects

Each effect declares two independent operations:

- `alignment_effect` preserves or sets derived alignment;
- `attention_effect` records no attention, attention if scientifically
  identified, or required reassessment attention.

Preserving alignment may still record research attention. Every effect sets
`automatic_run` to `false`. The user decides whether to run or rerun any phase.

## Change control

Package validation confirms that the aggregate and split contracts are exactly
identical. The prose and executable contracts change together.

A change to phase meaning, authority, prepared context, role visibility, method
alignment, publication, or user control requires an architecture decision and
corresponding schema, example, and scenario changes. Any disagreement is a
contract failure, not an invitation for runtime inference.
